and cool_class = id * (id option) * feature list

get attrs in parent class (feature list) then just prepend to the list of class child
then run redef on all attrs?

get methods in parent class (method list) then just prepend to the list of class child
then run redef on all methods? (check if formals are the same then return type is the same)
